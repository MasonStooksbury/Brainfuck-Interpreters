# Brainfuck Interpreters

<br>

## What is this and why?
Learning new programming languages can be difficult. One way that helps me is to write a bunch of different programs (or rewrite old stuff from other languages) as a way to get more practice using the various parts of the language. It helps to have something I'm familiar with, but also has enough challenge where I can really dig into the strengths or inconveniences of a given language.

A Brainfuck interpreter is - for me - a great program to write as it includes enough pitfalls that you can easily get stuck, but is also simple enough that you can do it in a couple of hours, worst case.

## Wait, what is Brainfuck?
Brainfuck is a Turing-complete, esoteric language created by Urban Müller in 1993. Building off of Corrado Böhm's `P''` ("P double-prime") language, Brainfuck allows for easy input/output with the operators `,` and `.` respectively.
